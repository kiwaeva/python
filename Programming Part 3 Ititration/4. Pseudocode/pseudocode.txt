Pseudocode is used to design programs
It is intended for humans to read and not for a computer to interpret. 
There is no specific syntax for pseudocode, and it should be human 
readable so that a programmer can translate it into program code. 

pseudocode example below:
Ask user to Enter username 
IF username entered ==/equal "python"
THEN 
Print/output: "your name is " username
ELSE
Print/output: "Incorrect username, try again"
